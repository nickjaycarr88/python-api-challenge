# python-api-challenge
##This project was designed to test my knwoledge of accessing and importing API information, searching through the information to retrieve relevant data and then to post that data to a dataframe. The next phase of the module was to filter the dataframe to match my exact needs and then create a heat and layer map using latitude and longituede coordinates.

#A few findings from WeatherPy 
1-The wind speed for both northern and southern hemisphere is generally below 20 mph for the whole world. However there is no strong correlation between the latitude and wind speed data. The use of a scatter plot is helpful to show how little correlation there is.
2-As you can probably guess, the humidity decreases the furthere away you are from the equator. Both northern hemisphere- humidity vs latitude and southern hemisphere- humidity vs latitude scatter plots with a linear regression line thoroughly indicate this.
3-In relation to cloudiness v latitude, there is abviously clouds throughout the world. An interesting abservation is that at both the north and south pole there are no clouds present.
